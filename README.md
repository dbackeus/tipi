Tipi is an integrated, feature-complete HTTP/S server for Ruby applications.
Tipi is built on Polyphony, a robust, high-performance library for building
highly-concurrent applications in Ruby. Tipi can be used to serve any Rack
application or set of static files directly without having to employ a
reverse-proxy such as Nginx.

  [Polyphony](https://github.com/digital-fabric/polyphony)
* Full support for HTTP, HTTP/2, WebSocket protocols
* Built-in SSL termination for secure, encrypted connections
* Automatic ALPN protocol selection
* Request and response body streaming for efficient downloads and uploads
* Full support for Rack-based apps
